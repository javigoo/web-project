1. Implement, correctly, the model you have proposed.

2. Activate the Django Admin interface to add, modify and delete instances.

3. Add authentication and user management (use Django built-in authentication or OAuth2).

5. Implement a deployment schema in order to:

	a. Integrate TravisCI as a continuous integration tool.

	b. Run the application as a docker container.
